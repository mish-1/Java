1) Security – Pointers allow direct access to memory addresses, which can cause unauthorized memory access and security issues. Java avoids this to maintain a secure environment.

2) Simplicity – Pointer usage involves complex operations like dereferencing and address manipulation. Java eliminates pointers to keep the language simple.

3) Automatic Memory Management – Java uses garbage collection for automatic memory allocation and deallocation, so pointers are not required.

4) Object References – Java uses references instead of pointers. References do not expose memory addresses, preventing misuse.
